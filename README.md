# Analysis-Of-Airbnb-Listings
The goal of the project is to analyze the Airbnb listings in six major cities (New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco,
Boston, Chicago, and DC) in the United States. Airbnb Inc. is an American company that operates an online marketplace
for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. It lists more than 6 million rooms and houses
in 81,000 cities. The platform has more than 150 million users worldwide with 2 million people staying in Airbnb rentals
across the world on any given night. Given the extremely large quantity of listings, this projectâ€™s dataset will contain
listing in only six US cities (New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, and DC).
